# Mirth-Connect-Channel-Report
## For non-developers : You need a server with a php configuration.
## Create a folder named "pdf_channels" with the other files because i can't create an empty folder in github.

This application generates a zip file containing pdf report of one or more Mirth channels.
When you get an XML file from Mirth channels you can use this program to create a pdf containing all the information of the channel.

Process: 
- push your XML file containing Mirth channel(s) 
- click on "Create PDF and download" 
- a ZIP file contains the PDF file(s) for each channel contained in the XML file pushed.
